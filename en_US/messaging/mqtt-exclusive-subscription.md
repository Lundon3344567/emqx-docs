# Exclusive Subscription

An exclusive subscription is an extended MQTT feature supported by EMQX. It allows mutually exclusive subscriptions to topics. Only one subscriber is allowed to subscribe to a topic at a time. Other subscribers will not be able to subscribe to the corresponding topic until the current subscriber unsubscribe from the subscription.

To make a subscription exclusive, you need to add a prefix to the topic heading. The table below shows an example:

| Example | Prefix | Real Topic Name |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| $exclusive/t/1 | $exclusive/ | t/1 |

When client **A** subscribes to `$exclusive/t/1`, other clients will fail to subscribe to `$exclusive/t/1` until **A** cancels the subscription to `$exclusive/t/1`.

::: tip Note

Exclusive subscriptions must be prefixed with `$exclusive/`, in the above example, other clients can still successfully subscribe via `t/1`.

:::

## Configure Exclusive Subscription via Configuration File

The exclusive subscription is disabled by default. You can enable this feature in `etc/emqx.conf`.

:::tip Note

Configuration using the Dashboard is currently not supported.

:::

```bash
mqtt.exclusive_subscription {
    enable = true
}
```
